# Body Parts: Aliens Fake Being a Human

## Goal

Body Parts takes a group of players, turns them into small aliens, and puts all
of them in control of one body. The goal of the game is two-fold:

1. Build or find a way to get back to your home planet, and
2. Complete ordinary, every day challenges without being caught

## Character Creation

All players are part of some alien race. The name of the alien race is the first
letter of everyone's last meal in one word. Each alien

1. is telepathic and can communicate with the others,
2. has a limited amount of energy and needs to rest after some actions, and
3. is small, weak, and defenseless outside the human robot.

Each player should select (or roll) a body part of the human robot to control. Each
body part should have some external function or consequence (i.e., you can't control
the heart unless it would serve some function for the game). Body parts that come
in pairs should generally belong to the same alien, although large, advanced, or
strange groups can divide pairs of body parts. Each body part also comes with a special
power or ability.

## Telepathy

Conversations happen in real time, and anything players say out loud is generally
meant that the human robot spoke out loud. However, aliens can communicate
telepathically with each other for a small amount of time.

TODO some rules about trading and gaining telepathy points

TODO telepathy should be allowed to walk back a statement once or twice
