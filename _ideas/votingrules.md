# Voting Rules Idea

1. Grab a whole host of two types of tokens.
   1. One type will be the yes/affirmative tokens.
   1. The other will be the no/negative tokens.
1. Each player should have a small pile of these tokens.
   1. We recommend mixing the two piles together and hiding them from the other
      players.
1. During play, whenever a player proposes an action that might have a chance of
   failure, take a vote.
   1. Pass a bag/bucket/basket/hat/whatever around the table.
   1. Each player puts a token in the bag to indicate whether they think the
      action should pass or succeed.
1. After everyone has voted, count the tokens to determine if the actions
   succeeds.
   1. If more than half of the tokens are yes tokens, the action succeeds, and
      play continues.
   1. If half or more are no tokens, the action fails. In the case of a tie, the
      no vote wins.
1. If the vote resulted in a no, give the bag to the player next to the player
   that wanted to perform the action.
   1. That player draws a token. If it is a yes token, that player decides the
      fate of the action.
   1. If it is a no token, pass the bag to the next player, and they draw.
   1. If there are no yes tokens in the bag, the player who requested the action
      should imagine the most drastic consequences of his or her foolishness, up
      to and including death (or fates that are worse...)
